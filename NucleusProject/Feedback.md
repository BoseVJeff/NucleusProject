# Attendance, Schedule, Report (Student-side)

## Feedback from Sir

### Overall Feedback

* Classes conducted should be determined by checking if attendance has been marked for the day.
* Less tables, more figures and graphs

### Attendance

* Imporve phrasing of various items in the attendance summary (All classes -> Classes scheduled for the semester | Classes marked - Classes Conducted | Present - Classes Attended)
* Show school and course code in each card entry
* Clicking on the card should take them to the schedule filtered by the course

### Schedule
* Mark classes that are in the past but not marked seperately
* Classes that are in the current time slot but have already been marked
* Order columns as Date > Time > ...
* Filter classes by course (with filter above the schedule table)

### Report
* Rename button to reflect file that will be downloaded (Download Report -> Download Marksheet)
